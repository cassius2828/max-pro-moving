How to Calculate Quote(What is the cutoff for each one?):
    Timing: 
        - Early Bird
        - Right On Time
        - Last Minute
    Movers + Hours:
        - 2M, 2H = $220-EB
        - 2M, 2H = $220-ROT
        - 2M, 2H = $220-LM
        - 4M, 4H = $880-EB
        - 4M, 4H = $1000-ROT
        - 4M, 4H = $1200-LM
    Base Truck Cost: 
        EB = $45
        ROT = $50
        LM = $65
    Milage Variable:
        EB = $1.70
        ROT = $1.80
        LM = $1.90
    Min Range(min price?):
        EB = $282
        ROT = $318
        LM = $384

    Max Range(max price or max distance?):
        EB = $942
        ROT = $1068
        LM = $1284

Costs that need to be determined:
    - Elevator cost (fixed add on or percentage to total?)
    - How much is a single item? Are all single items charged the same or different? Examples of each type of single item and the prices. Do we need a size or weight reference for key? 
    - Junk removal. Are we calculating cost by distnace to junk yard? 
    - Truck specifics: How do we calculate this? Will there be a disclaimer for how much more it could be based on option B or C? Option A is a range, how do we know if they need 0 trucks, 1 truck, or two trucks?
    - Stairs: Fix price addition for each flight or adding to the total percentage? 
    - Disassembly and reassemble: How much is this service? 
    - Specialty Items: How much more do speciality items cost ?
    - Large / Heavy Items: How much more do these heavy items cost? 
    - Junk removal add on: How much more is this service? How do we determine the cost ? 

    My understanding: 
    - The complete info in the form is for you to look at and determine a specific price 
    - The quote generator is only gathering a generalized range to display to the client 
    - Are we sending the generalized quote with a disclaimer that rates may change due to specific attributes of their submission 
    and that they will be given a precise quote when in contact with the staff memeber? Or is the client 
    getting the results of thier detailed answers with the general quote sent to their phone? 


    Further Questions:
    Truck Price:
        26' Truck price = ?
        16' - 20' Truck price = ?
    Cutoff time for each timeframe (EB, ROT, LM)
    Junk Removal: Specific location you bring the junk to or does it vary? 
    When they provide the trucks and transportation, are the questions of how many just for intel purposes? 
    How many movers and hours is used for Single Item Delivery? 


    Questions for myself:
    Would this site benefit from a mongoDB database to store the quote documents for easy access later on? 
        Benefits would include:
        - search through with keywords
        - mark status as new, accepted, rejected, archived
        - filter by date, area code range, num of trucks, type of job, name, price, etc 

Meeting with Lima:

    - ensure they are pointed to CA 
    - cap on total amount of miles or if it is out of state then show different screen (being processed, interstate project, expert within 24-48 hours), only show CA 
    - route based on miles, if over 100+ miles do not show estimate, expert contact you
